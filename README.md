# Agile Transformation Coefficient Assessment Tool - ATCAT

Software engineering is about specifying, developing, managing, and evolving software systems. To effectively produce a software product, software engineers carry out a set of activities that conduct a software process. 

Nowadays, we may classify the paradigms of software processes as non-evolutionary, evolutionary, and agile process models. While the first two are closer to well-characterized methods and theories from computer science, agile methods are ruled by empiric and adaptive processes, being more pervasive to bad practices.

Also, the promise of a quick software product delivery aligned with the business-value focus has led organizations to rapid adoption of agile methodologies without care for the required management and organizational practice changes. Recognizing these challenges, what began to be a coaching tool to assess the seriousness of an agile implementation evolved into a diagnostic method to evaluate whether an organization was agile-compliant.

This paper aims to present a comprehensive discussion on the diagnosis of agile projects. It provides details of agile principles, descriptions of three of the most used agile methods, and solutions to existing diagnosis techniques.

Lastly, it proposes a new approach to address the research question of when a project may be deemed agile. This approach involves the development of a self-assessment tool, which can effectively measure the Diagnostic Percentage Score and Radar of Agile Coefficient Score. This tool evaluates the success factors of agile transformation within a team or an organization, instilling confidence in its efficacy.
